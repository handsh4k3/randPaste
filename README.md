# randPaste
A little python script that fetches the public pastes appearing in the right sidedar of pastebin.com
It's messy and it requires to be rearranged, but it does the job it's made for.
It relies on bs4(BeautifulSoup4) for the data extraction.
I'll add the argument parsing with the argparse python built-in module, for better handling of 
flags, user input and help printing.
